How to get a build system started:

1)
  Download Cygwin from
    http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe

  Run setup.exe, and install at least bash, and the basic command line utilities (awk, grep, etc...). Also wget should be installed. You do not need to pick out all the required packages yet.

  Continue through and install cygwin.

2)
  Start up a Cygwin shell, and run:
  wget http://stephenjungels.com/jungels.net/projects/apt-cyg/apt-cyg -O /usr/bin/apt-cyg

3)
  Issue:
  apt-cyg install mercurial
  
4)
  cd /cygdrive/c/
  mkdir build
  cd build
  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/a1kmm/physiome-build
  cd physiome-build/cygwin-build
  ./setup-build-environment.sh

5)
  At several points things will pop up on the screen. Read the text in the Cygwin window for instructions.
