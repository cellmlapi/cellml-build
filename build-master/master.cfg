# This is a sample buildmaster config file. It must be installed as
# 'master.cfg' in your buildmaster's base directory (although the filename
# can be changed with the --basedir option to 'mktap buildbot master').

# It has one job: define a dictionary named BuildmasterConfig. This
# dictionary has a variety of keys to control different aspects of the
# buildmaster. They are documented in docs/config.xhtml .


# This is the dictionary that the buildmaster pays attention to. We also use
# a shorter alias to save typing.

####### BUILDSLAVES

# the 'slaves' list defines the set of allowable buildslaves. Each element is
# a BuildSlave object, which is created with bot-name, bot-password.  These
# correspond to values given to the buildslave's mktap invocation.

# to limit to two concurrent builds on a slave, use
#  c['slaves'] = [BuildSlave("bot1name", "bot1passwd", max_builds=2)]


# 'slavePortnum' defines the TCP port to listen on. This must match the value
# configured into the buildslaves (with their --master option)

c['slavePortnum'] = 9989

####### CHANGESOURCES

# the 'change_source' setting tells the buildmaster how it should find out
# about source code changes. Any class which implements IChangeSource can be
# put here: there are several in buildbot/changes/*.py to choose from.

from buildbot.changes.pb import PBChangeSource
c['change_source'] = PBChangeSource()

# For example, if you had CVSToys installed on your repository, and your
# CVSROOT/freshcfg file had an entry like this:
#pb = ConfigurationSet([
#    (None, None, None, PBService(userpass=('foo', 'bar'), port=4519)),
#    ])

# then you could use the following buildmaster Change Source to subscribe to
# the FreshCVS daemon and be notified on every commit:
#
#from buildbot.changes.freshcvs import FreshCVSSource
#fc_source = FreshCVSSource("cvs.example.com", 4519, "foo", "bar")
#c['change_source'] = fc_source

# or, use a PBChangeSource, and then have your repository's commit script run
# 'buildbot sendchange', or use contrib/svn_buildbot.py, or
# contrib/arch_buildbot.py :
#
#from buildbot.changes.pb import PBChangeSource
#c['change_source'] = PBChangeSource()

####### BUILDERS

# the 'builders' list defines the Builders. Each one is configured with a
# dictionary, using the following keys:
#  name (required): the name used to describe this builder
#  slavename (required): which slave to use (must appear in c['bots'])
#  builddir (required): which subdirectory to run the builder in
#  factory (required): a BuildFactory to define how the build is run
#  periodicBuildTime (optional): if set, force a build every N seconds

# buildbot/process/factory.py provides several BuildFactory classes you can
# start with, which implement build processes for common targets (GNU
# autoconf projects, CPAN perl modules, etc). The factory.BuildFactory is the
# base class, and is configured with a series of BuildSteps. When the build
# is run, the appropriate buildslave is told to execute each Step in turn.

# the first BuildStep is typically responsible for obtaining a copy of the
# sources. There are source-obtaining Steps in buildbot/steps/source.py for
# CVS, SVN, and others.

# before you have a functioning 'sources' set up). The debug tool uses the
# same port number as the slaves do: 'slavePortnum'.

#c['debugPassword'] = "debugpassword"

# if you set 'manhole', you can ssh into the buildmaster and get an
# interactive python shell, which may be useful for debugging buildbot
# internals. It is probably only useful for buildbot developers. You can also
# use an authorized_keys file, or plain telnet.

# with an externally-visible host name which the buildbot cannot figure out
# without some help.
